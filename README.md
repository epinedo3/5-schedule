# 5-schedule

## Description

The purpose of this Challenge-5 was to create a Daily Schedule planner (9AM-5PM). Using a starting code that was provided. I had to clone it, and edit it to meet my code needs. In this challenge we had to use API's such as JQuery and Day.js in order to make this code function properly. Thanks to this challenge I believe to have a better grasp of third-party API's. Not completely understanding the sunject, but its getting there.
